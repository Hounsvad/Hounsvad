### Hello welcome to my profile. ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an open source system for managing virtual machines for classes. The system interfaces with OpenNebula, and handles simple configuration of machines as well.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to program Rust as it seems like the future of performant computing as well as programming micros.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking forward to these next few years, as i'll finish my masters in Software Engineering, and it will be amazing to start working for real.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, and im here to help out or talk to.
